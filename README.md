### Game Description
Lunacy is a 2D psychological horror game. You wake up in an open clearing with things shifting just out of sight. There is a single dwindling campfire in the middle. You have to survive each night and rekindle/revive the campfire before it runs out. Gather wood and leaves to restock it before you lose your sanity. Survive long enough and send out an S.O.S. to escape! Don't take too long before things come for you...
